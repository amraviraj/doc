Git installation and config:

1.install git from git website.

2. config:
    git config --global user.name "user name"
    git config --global user.email "email id"

3. create a new floder like client name and inside create project name: project 1

4. cd C:\git\project1 inside of floder

   right click-> git bash here->enter "git init"


5.git remote add origin "url of repo"  it will do config central to local background activity



first some doing git config:
(already we hae file in central means follow below step)

git clone <project url> it will download master branch data only.
  particular branch means git clone -b "branch name" "project url"
already any file in central repo it will download to local repo..

          6.but if already config done means:

"git pull origin master"(now it will download all the file from central to local repo)

6.doing some changes in a file...

     then use a command "git status" (it will show untracked file)
     "git add"(to tracked file)
     "git add -A"(multiple file tracked)
     "git commit -m" "message" file name (commit single file with message)
      "git commit -a -m" "message"(commit multiple file with message)

7."git push origin master"
   it will ask user name and passowrd
   after that it will upload to central repo

8.but if multiple guys working in same project:
follow 5.2 point and follow 6th point.After that again use a pull command and push command.(why means first person did any changes after you pull the same doc,thatnot updated in your file so follow pull and push))

2guys download same project
 1st guy doing some chnaged evg 5 o clk    project -> pull -work -> finish(commit)->push
but still 2nd guy working on it,this 2nd guy will push means(6 o clk) it wont take 1st guy update, so always use follow formet 

project -> pull -work -> finish(commit)-> pull ->push

9.
we need to check current branch details use a command "git branch"(it will show the current branch details and all branch name)
we need to check current origin details use a command "git remote -v"(it will show fetch and push project name)

$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/amraviraj/final-test.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/amraviraj/final-test.git (push)

10.

all file like master QA dev file in one local folder means ,create 3 folder nad move the file based on process.
(for old project ) 1st time only
   

   1. "git init" in master file foloder once and git remote add origin <repo url>
   2."git init" in dev file folder once and git remote add origin <repo url>
   3. 'git init" in qa file foloder once and git remote add origin <repo url>

then add commit 

git branch "branch name" (to create new branch)

git checkout QA(branch name) it will switch to QA branch,but QA branch name not central repo no issue after push it will create newe branch QA
then push


2nd time onwards follow 6th point and 7th point
